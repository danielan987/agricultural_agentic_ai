# Future Clouds

## Background
It is challenging to predict the weather months or years in advance. However, that is what's required when preparing for a trip in advance. We don't want it to be too hot or cold, too windy, raining or snowing too much, or even too humid or dry. Often, we have to guess and hope for the best. This user-friendly, agentic AI app allows users to get a weather prediction on a specified location and a date with agentic AI to provide further context on the future weather situation. 

## Architecture

On Streamlit, a user selects a location on OpenStreetMap. The latitude and longitude of that location are sent to two native plugins. The first one retrieves relevant search results from DuckDuckGo including local agricultural regulations and market demands. The second one retrieves the earliest to latest soil moisture data from 1981 to the present day from the NASA POWER API. This amount of historical data makes it possible to forecast soil moisture levels 365 days into the future using the Prophet library. The data retrieved from these plugins gets added to the chat history to be used by the agents. Within the agent group chat, powered by the "gpt-4o-mini" model from OpenAI, the selector strategy selects the location identifier agent in response to the user input. This agent describes the location’s climate, mentions what was found in the DuckDuckGo search results, and makes recommendations. This response leads to the data analyst agent responding with analysis and recommendations based on the soil moisture forecast data it retrieved from the NASA data plugin. Eventually, the termination strategy ends the agents' responses, and they get produced on Streamlit, but the user can include a follow-up prompt to continue the conversation.    


## Data Source
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has developed Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), which consists of a variety of Earth's climate data since 1981. The data that was used for this project has a parameter name "GWETROOT" and this consists of soil moisture levels across the globe from the surface to 100 cm below the surface (depth of most crops' roots). The value ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating there is no water in the soil and 1 indicating the soil is saturated. There are limitations to this data as it involves modeling and assimilation. Some locations do not have soil moisture data for a variety of reasons, including if the location is in the ocean, and they may have a value of "-999", which gets cleaned before forecasting.
